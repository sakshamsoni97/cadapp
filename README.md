# CADapp

This short application was developed in C++ as an assignment for the course COP290 under Prof. Subhashis Banerjee during Spring 2017-18. This application provides a method to generate Orthographic projections of a polyhedral object from its 3D specification and to reconstruct a 3D object from its orthographic projections. The application checks for object validity and has a simple GUI to interact and input projection/object specification and generate and render the projection/3D object.

## Libraries Used
* GLUT: OpenGL Utility Toolkit - To render the drawings
* GTK+ - To create the GUI
* stl: Standard Template Library - For *map* and *tuple* data structures
