This short application was developed in C++ as an assignment for the course C\+O\+P290 under Prof. Subhashis Banerjee during Spring 2017-\/18. This application provides a method to generate Orthographic projections of a polyhedral object from its 3D specification and to reconstruct a 3D object from its orthographic projections. The application checks for object validity and has a simple G\+UI to interact and input projection/object specification and generate and render the projection/3D object.
